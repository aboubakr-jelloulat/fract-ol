## 📌 Introduction
Fract-ol is a project from the 42 curriculum that explores fractals using the MiniLibX graphics library. The goal is to generate and display visually stunning fractals, focusing on the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and implement fractals using mathematical formulas.
- Gain experience with graphical rendering using the MiniLibX library.
- Handle user interactions such as zooming, movement, and fractal variation.

## 🖥️ Features
✅ Mandelbrot Set Visualization  
✅ Julia Set Visualization  
✅ Infinite Zooming (within computer limits)  
✅ Color Gradient to Enhance Visualization  
✅ Smooth Window Management  
✅ User Interaction (Mouse & Keyboard)  

## 📜 Installation & Usage

### 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the MiniLibX library installed.

### 🚀 Compilation
Clone the repository and compile the project:
```bash
make
```

### 🎮 Running the Program
Run the program with one of the supported fractal types:
```bash
./fractol 1
./fractol 2 <x_value> <y_value>
```
If no valid parameters are provided, the program will display usage instructions.

### 🕹️ Controls
- **Mouse Scroll** → Zoom In/Out
- **Arrow Keys** → Move Around
- **ESC** → Exit Program


## 📜 Project Requirements
- Must use the **MiniLibX** library.
- No global variables allowed.
- Memory management must be handled properly.

## 🏆 Credits
Developed as part of the 42 Network curriculum.
